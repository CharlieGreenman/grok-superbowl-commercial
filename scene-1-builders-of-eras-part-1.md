## ⚡ 6-Second Scene Prompt (Seconds 0-6)

```
Cute anime cyberpunk: Black cyber-blacksmith (large expressive eyes, rosy cheeks, innocent expression) dramatically hammering glowing neural circuits on dystopian rooftop at golden hour sunrise, digital sparks exploding into holographic sky. Cinematic low-angle shot, heavily wet glossy skin with droplets, kodak portra 800 film grain, soft bokeh, lens flares from neon signs, epic lighting. Quick cut to diverse cyber-NASA engineers (Asian, Hispanic, White with implants, anime features) cheering as rocket roars through underground bay vents, golden hour glow. Final frame: Indigenous net-hacker on megabuilding peak jacking into code under Milky Way with satellites, ultra glossy skin, photorealistic grain.

**Voiceover (6 sec):** "Not the loudest. The ones who build worlds."

Create a cute, hand-drawn anime style image inspired by classic tales with large expressive eyes, rosy flushed cheeks, soft rounded features, innocent wondrous expressions on all characters, titled "The Builders of Eras - Part 1" with an epic, wondrous, adventurous tone reimagined in a cyberpunk theme: masterpiece, golden hour lighting, dramatic warm sunlight piercing through dystopian megacity streets, flickering holograms, heavily wet glossy skin on characters with visible water droplets rolling down bodies and cybernetic enhancements, gritty urban decay blended with high-tech glows, cinematic perspective with low-angle tilted street-style composition, kodak portra 800 + fuji superia film emulation, heavy film grain, soft cinematic bokeh, extremely detailed skin texture, high fashion editorial styling, seductive yet innocent gazes, dramatic focus shifts, motion blur effects, shallow depth of field, lens flares from neon signs and sunlight, epic cyberpunk lighting with warm dramatic contrasts.

Scene: Joyful composite montage in a dystopian megacity—A Black cyber-blacksmith (large expressive eyes, rosy flushed cheeks, soft rounded features, innocent wondrous expression) dramatically hammering glowing neural circuits on rooftop ledge at golden hour sunrise, digital sparks exploding into holographic sky (dramatic warm sunlight, heavily wet glossy skin with droplets, heavy film grain, soft bokeh, detailed texture, seductive yet innocent gaze); Diverse 1960s-inspired cyber-NASA engineers (Asian, Hispanic, White team members with implants, all with large expressive eyes, rosy flushed cheeks, soft rounded features, innocent wondrous expressions) cheering in windswept underground launch bay as rocket roars upward through vents (golden hour lighting filtering in, wet reflective skin, film emulation, detailed textures, high fashion vibes); An Indigenous early net-hacker pioneer (large expressive eyes, rosy flushed cheeks, soft rounded features, innocent wondrous expression) sitting on megabuilding peak at golden hour dusk, jacking into code under polluted Milky Way pierced by satellites (lens bloom from city lights and warm sun, ultra glossy skin with droplets, photorealistic grain, seductive yet innocent gaze).
