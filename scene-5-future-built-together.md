## ⚡ 6-Second Scene Prompt (Seconds 24-30)

```
Cute anime cyberpunk space: Diverse workers (African, European, Southeast Asian with cyber mods, large expressive eyes, innocent expressions) dancing in orbital factory under twin suns. Rocket launches from beach sim while surfers on hoverboards cheer in zero-G. Farmers riding glowing drones over golden orbital farms like flying skateboards. Cities growing upward, people ziplining between orbital towers. Finale: Kid on orbital cliff at sunrise, wind in hair, typing code as sky ignites with galaxies. Grok logo as cosmic neural starburst. Heavily wet glossy skin, kodak portra 800 grain, epic lighting, lens bloom.
```

**Voiceover (6 sec):** "Built by people having the time of their lives with Grok."

```
Create a cute, hand-drawn anime style image inspired by classic tales with large expressive eyes, rosy flushed cheeks, soft rounded features, innocent wondrous expressions on all characters, titled "The Future Built Together" with a triumphant, cosmic, insanely fun tone reimagined in a cyberpunk theme: masterpiece, golden hour lighting, dramatic warm sunlight piercing through sprawling dystopian orbital cities, flickering neon megastructures in space, heavily wet glossy skin on cybernetic workers with visible water droplets rolling down glowing implants, gritty cosmic debris fields blended with high-tech spectacles, cinematic perspective with low-angle tilted street-style composition, kodak portra 800 + fuji superia film emulation, heavy film grain, soft cinematic bokeh, extremely detailed skin texture, high fashion editorial styling, seductive yet innocent gazes, dramatic focus shifts, motion blur effects, shallow depth of field, lens flares from starship engines and sunlight, epic cyberpunk lighting with warm dramatic contrasts.

Scene: Triumphant cosmic fun composite montage in dystopian orbital space—Diverse workers (including African, European, and Southeast Asian individuals with cyber mods, all with large expressive eyes, rosy flushed cheeks, soft rounded features, innocent wondrous expressions) dancing while machines build in a futuristic open-air factory sim under twin artificial suns (dramatic shadows from neon grids, heavily wet glossy skin with droplets, heavy film grain, soft bokeh, detailed textures, seductive yet innocent gazes); Rocket launching from a beach sim while surfers (mixed ethnicities like Middle Eastern and Indigenous with hoverboards, all with large expressive eyes, rosy flushed cheeks, soft rounded features, innocent wondrous expressions) cheer below in zero-G (fast transition feel with digital effects, wet reflective skin, film emulation); Farmers (Hispanic and South Asian with drone implants, large expressive eyes, rosy flushed cheeks, soft rounded features, innocent wondrous expressions) riding glowing drones over golden field sims like flying skateboards in orbital farms (natural rhythm, ultra glossy skin with droplets, high fashion vibes); Massive server lights pulsing under the northern lights AR display (lens bloom from energy fields); Cities growing upward with people (diverse global mix, all with large expressive eyes, rosy flushed cheeks, soft rounded features, innocent wondrous expressions) ziplining between orbital towers in space suits (balanced composition); Enormous interstellar shipyard in orbit with construction crews (representing all ethnicities in cyber suits, large expressive eyes, rosy flushed cheeks, soft rounded features, innocent wondrous expressions) waving like rockstars amid cosmic neon (epic lighting with bold contrasts); Grok logo as glowing cosmic neural starburst with cyber glitches; Same kid from earlier standing on an orbital cliff sim at golden hour sunrise, wind blowing hair in artificial gravity, typing first line of code, sky igniting with swirling galaxies and digital possibilities (immersive tone, photorealistic grain).
