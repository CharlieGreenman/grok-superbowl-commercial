```
Cute anime cyberpunk: Elegant holographic Grok interface materializing like floating digital magic in neon megacity plaza at golden hour, tickets assembling like glowing fireflies, roadmap constellations connecting in AR. Quick transition to diverse startup team (Black, White, East Asian with cyber enhancements, large expressive eyes, innocent expressions) sprinting down glowing grassy hill in rooftop park, high-fiving, then jumping into holographic lake in celebration. Heavily wet glossy skin with droplets, kodak portra 800 grain, soft bokeh, rain effects, lens flares, joyful energy.
